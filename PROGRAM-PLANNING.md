# Discord Bot - Tekhs

## Preface

This program is a discord bot designed for the UTS FEIT discord server for students of UTS. The aim of this discord bot is to provide administrative tasks as well as provide a better quality of life of people using the UTS FEIT discord server by enhancing their experience through a list of commands either; automating or simplifying pre-existing discord lobbies or conversations.

## Features List

- Add the possibility of automatically recording discord share screens in lobbies for remote lectures

- Some music bot features such as listening to voice when the 'Hey Tekhs' command is given allowing people to remotely queue songs or adjust volume whilst in game without the requirement of typing

- Additional administrative features such as purge

- Other general bot commands

- Plugins as Alex suggested?

- Anonymous Rants - Let members pm the bot directly and the bot will relay that msg in the `#rant` channel

## Stack List/specification

- Oracle JDK 11
- SQL Lite
- FFMPEG (For Music Bot?)
- Google Cloud - Text to speech API
- [Discord Java Wrapper](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

## Discord Bots Basic Feature List

### General Idea

- Make this as a web-app menu for configuration (maybe and contain the majority of these functions as "plugins" allowing people to enable or disable features as they wish)

### Administrative Functions

> 
> - How will input be structured maybe some sort of markup / markdown?

> `<JOIN MESSAGE>` This function automatically sends a message to the main lobby of the discord server upon joining. It says `<Tekh>` has joined with a custom joining message in addition with some information regarding the bot.

> Also auto-moderation to - mute, kick and ban after violation of rules.
